Based on the provided data, it's evident that the Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm outperforms the other scheduling algorithms in terms of efficiency. This conclusion is drawn from the following observations:

- The average waiting time for RR is 8.0, which is the lowest among all the algorithms (FCFS, SJF, PS, and RR).
- The average turnaround time for RR is 18.5, which is also the lowest compared to FCFS, SJF, and PS.

Therefore, based on these metrics, Round Robin demonstrates superior efficiency in this specific scenario.
